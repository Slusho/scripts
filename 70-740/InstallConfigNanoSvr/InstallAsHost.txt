In lab envirornment, if using Hyper-V which does not allow booting VM from USB, perform the following steps:
Create a new VHDX Hard Disk Image 32Gb in size name it BootMedia
Format drive in DiskPart
    List Disk
    Select Disk Number
    Clean
    Create Partition Primary
    Format FS=FAT32 Quick
    Assign
    Active
After formating, mount the virtual drive
Launch the Deployment and Imaging Tools Envirornment as administrator and type the following commands
'copype amd64 c:\winpe_amd64' 
'makewinpemedia /ufd c:\winpe_amd64 [location of mounted drive IE e:]'
Copy NanoServer to the WinPE boot media
    Create a folder on boot media name it nanoserver1
    Copy Packages folder and NanoServer.wim from the NanoServer folder on the Windows Server 2016 disk or ISO into nanoserver1 folder on boot media
Unmount boot media
Create new VM
    Generation 2
    512MB Memory
    Choose your virtual switch
    Create new virtual disk 32Gb
    Install OS later
    Finish
    Go to settings of new VM, SCSI controller, add hard drive
    Browse to BootMedia VHDX
    Go to firmware and move up BootMedia hard drive to top
    Connect and start VM and it will boot from boot media
Now ready to install Nano Server to host
At CMD prompt diskpart to format hard drive
    List Disk 
    Select Disk 0
    Clean
    Convert gpt
    Create partition efi size=10 #system partition
    Format quick fs=fat32 label="system"
    Assign letter="s"
    Create partition msr size=128
    Create partition Primary
    Format quick fs=ntfs label="nanoserver"
    Assign letter="n"
    exit
Apply Image
    Dism /apply-image /imagefile:c:\nanoserver1\nanoserver.wim /index:1 /applydir:n:\ #change to c:\ in production
    bcdboot.exe n:\windows /s s: #copies boot files 
    wpeutil reboot
Change the boot order in VM settings to boot from nanoserver drive not from BootMedia and boot again
Will fail as it needs drivers, this is normal :)
